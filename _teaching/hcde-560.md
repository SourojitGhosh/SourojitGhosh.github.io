This course explored rapid developments in the field of Generative AI, providing technical and non-technical explanations of key concepts for interdisciplinary students to build practical understanding. Students developed skills to navigate the changing AI landscape, work effectively with AI systems, and contribute to AI-driven innovations across disciplines.
