What does it mean to design for all humans? How do we design inclusively? What does "inclusive" mean, and what are the practices that undergird building an inclusive society? What are the ethical implications of "inclusivity," and how can we evaluate them?

This course surveyed a range of methods in design and engineering that examine, support, and interrogate these questions. Students were provided a strong understanding of the differences between inclusive, universal, and accessible design via daily readings and in-class discussions, accompanied by inclusivity analyses of designed artefacts and proposed redesigns.
