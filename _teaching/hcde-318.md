This introductory course explored the fundamentals of thinking like a user-centered designer, as students explored the full user-centered design cycle from a broad perspective, with an emphasis on the importance of developing and applying design processes and strategies. Through hands-on experience in user research, ideation, prototyping, and evaluation of their own designed objects, students obtained deeper insights into their own skills and interests as budding designers.   

The course also provided critical perspectives on design, as students engaged with topics like discrimination by design and data feminism, helping them grow their abilities to identify the myriad explicit and implicit choices made in design processes.
