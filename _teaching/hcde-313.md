This course introduced user research methods, how to apply them within engineering and design contexts, and how to effectively communicate the results of user research. Students gained practice in different user research methods -- field observations, surveys, and interviews -- around a central research question. Throughout their course experience, students learned about the value of each method and when to use them, as well as ways to synthesize a large volume of user research into actionable insights. 

During my time in this course, I also __mentored my co-Instructor__, a budding STEM educator themselves and a second-year HCDE doctoral student. We spent some time after class sessions discussing the events of the day, reflecting upon successes and opportunities for improvement in the future.
