This course explored the usage of Generative Artificial Intelligence tools and Large Language Models in the User-Centered Design process, considering the various advantages and limitations they bring to the table. Students engaged in deep reading of cutting-edge literature and acquired hands-on experience using various AI tools within the designed process in a sandboxed environment, cultivating their own designer philosophies with respect to AI usage.

This was a __new course that I designed__ for the HCDE curriculum, in recognition of an emergent need within graduating students to acquire AI proficiency in design, which was being required by potential recruiters.
