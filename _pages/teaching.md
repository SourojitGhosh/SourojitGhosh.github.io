My teaching integrates critical human-centered practice into varied courses such as AI for Beginners, Responsible AI, User-Centered Design, Data Visualization, Experimental Research and Statistics, and Accessibility. Across diverse course modalities, my pedagogy values experiential learning, as I prioritize hands-on and student-led engagement with course material through practical applications.
