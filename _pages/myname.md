<div align="justify"> Inspired by <a href = "http://denaeford.me/">Dr. Denae Ford Robinson</a>, I decided to add a page on how to pronounce and use my name.</div>

<br/>

<div align="justify"> My first name is pronounced as Show-row-jeet, and my last name is pronounced as G-oh-sh. </div>

<br/>

<div align="justify"> You may refer to me by my first name in emails and in daily conversations, unless I have introduced myself to you as G. In that case, you may refer to me as G. <div/>
