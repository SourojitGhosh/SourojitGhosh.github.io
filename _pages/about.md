<div align="justify"> Hello! My name is Sourojit (pronounced show-row-jeet, IPA /ˈʃoʊ-rəʊ-d͡ʒit/) Ghosh, though I go by G, and I am a fourth year PhD Candidate at the University of Washington, Seattle in <a href = "https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design and Engineering</a>. I am a member of the Human-Centered Data Sciences Lab, being advised by <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/">Dr. Cecilia Aragon</a>. <br><br> 
  I investigate how the outputs of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools cause harm towards traditionally marginalized populations. I specifically focus on identities and populations typically overlooked in AI-fairness scholarship, as I explore human-centered and community-based approaches towards more equitable outcomes. My interests are situated in the broad space of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within designed systems, as I also incorporate into my work other topics such as advocating for supporting HyFlex modalities of learning to improve accessibility within the larger context of practicing radical inclusion in the classroom, and stronger and more accurate representation for low-resource languages in machine translation systems. <br><br>
  I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, receiving a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Writing, and completed a Master's in Human Centered Design and Engineering. Outside of my academic interests, I am an aspiring writer and hope to someday have my own publication of fictional short stories! </div>
