Hello! My name is Sourojit Ghosh, but most of my colleagues know me as G! I am currently a first year PhD student at the University of Washington, Seattle in [Human Centered Design and Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/). I am a part of the Human-Centered Data Sciences Lab, being advised by [Dr. Cecilia Aragon](https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/).
