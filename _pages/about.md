<div align="justify"> Hello! My name is Sourojit (pronounced show-row-jeet, IPA /ˈʃoʊ-rəʊ-d͡ʒit/) Ghosh, though I go by G, and I am a fifth-year PhD Candidate (ABD) at the University of Washington, Seattle in <a href = "https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design and Engineering</a>. I am a member of the Human-Centered Data Sciences Lab, being advised by <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/">Dr. Cecilia Aragon</a>. <br><br> 
  I investigate how the outputs of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools cause harm towards traditionally marginalized populations. I specifically focus on identities and populations typically overlooked in AI-fairness scholarship, as I explore human-centered and community-based approaches towards more equitable outcomes. I also incorporate into my work other topics such as advocating for supporting student needs in classrooms, and more accurate results for low-resource languages in machine translation systems. <br><br>
  I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, receiving a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Writing, and completed a Master's in Human Centered Design and Engineering. Outside of my academic interests, I am an aspiring writer and hope to someday have my own publication of fictional short stories! </div>
