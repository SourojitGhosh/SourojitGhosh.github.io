<div align="justify"> Hello! My name is Sourojit Ghosh. For prounciation aids, visit the <a href = "https://sourojitghosh.github.io/myname/">My Name</a> page! I am currently a third year PhD Candidate at the University of Washington, Seattle in <a href = "https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design and Engineering</a>. I am a part of the Human-Centered Data Sciences Lab, being advised by <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/">Dr. Cecilia Aragon</a>. My research is centered around studying human-centeredness in social recommender systems and designing such systems, as I explore questions of harm caused by existing social recommender systems towards traditionally marginalized populations. My interests are situated in the broad space of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) within designed systems, as I also incorporate into my work other topics such as advocating for supporting HyFlex modalities of learning to improve accessibility and designing for increased psychological safety of low-power individuals in aircraft flight decks. <br><br>
  I completed my undergraduate education from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, receiving a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Writing, and completed a Master's in Human Centered Design and Engineering. Outside of my academic interests, I am an aspiring writer and hope to someday have my own publication of fictional short stories! </div>
