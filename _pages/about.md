Hello! My name is Sourojit Ghosh, but most of my colleagues know me as G! I am currently a first year PhD student at the University of Washington, Seattle in [Human Centered Design and Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/). I am a part of the Human-Centered Data Sciences Lab, being advised by [Dr. Cecilia Aragon](https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/). My interests in the field revolve around utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to solve human-centered problems.  

I completed my undergraduate education from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, receiving a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Writing. Outside of my academic interests, I am an aspiring writer and hope to someday have my own publication of fictional short stories!
