<div align="justify"> Hello! My name is Sourojit Ghosh, but most of my colleagues know me as G! I am currently a first year PhD student at the University of Washington, Seattle in <a href = "https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design and Engineering</a>. I am a part of the Human-Centered Data Sciences Lab, being advised by <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/">Dr. Cecilia Aragon</a>. My interests in the field revolve around utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to solve human-centered problems.  </br> </br>

I completed my undergraduate education from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, receiving a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Writing. Outside of my academic interests, I am an aspiring writer and hope to someday have my own publication of fictional short stories! </div>
