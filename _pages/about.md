<div align="justify"> Hello! My name is Sourojit Ghosh (for prounciation aids, visit the <a href = "https://sourojitghosh.github.io/myname/">My Name</a> page! I am currently a third year PhD Candidate at the University of Washington, Seattle in <a href = "https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design and Engineering</a>. I am a part of the Human-Centered Data Sciences Lab, being advised by <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/">Dr. Cecilia Aragon</a>. My research is centered around human-centered social recommender systems and questions of harm caused by social recommender systems towards traditionally marginalized populations, with a focus on questions of diversity, equity and inclusion. <br><br>
  I completed my undergraduate education from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, receiving a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Writing, and completed a Master's in Human Centered Design and Engineering. Outside of my academic interests, I am an aspiring writer and hope to someday have my own publication of fictional short stories! </div>
